##Presentation

DoDoc is a documentation tool, first designed for use in classrooms with children. It is is a documentation platform connected to a physical device that operates a camera and a microphone, and enables one to capture traces from an on-going experience for later reflections, reconstructions and creation of narratives.<br> 
DoDoc is a research project developed by [l'atelier des chercheurs](http://latelier-des-chercheurs.fr/) (Sarah Garcin, Pauline Gourlet & Louis Eveillard).<br>
You can find more documentation and contribute to the project [here](http://www.lopendoc.org/dodoc/).<br>
