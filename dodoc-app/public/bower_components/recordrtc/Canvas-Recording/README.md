## Record Entire WebPage or Canvas2D

Features:

1. Realtime Canvas2D-animation recording is supported on Firefox 44+, and Chrome 53+
2. Older chrome supports webpage recording as well as canvas-2d animation recording. PS: Old Firefox is NOT supporting Canvas2D recording.

## Demos

1. [Record entire DIV including video, image, textarea, input, drag/move/resize, everything](https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/RecordRTC/Canvas-Recording/)
2. [Record canvas 2D drawings, lines, shapes, texts, images, drag/resize/enlarge/move via a huge drawing tool!](https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/RecordRTC/Canvas-Recording/record-canvas-drawings.html)
3. [Record Canvas2D Animation](https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/RecordRTC/Canvas-Recording/Canvas-Animation-Recording.html)

This [WebRTC](https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/) experiment is using [RecordRTC.js](https://github.com/muaz-khan/WebRTC-Experiment/tree/master/RecordRTC) to record HTML/Canvas into webm; where [html2canvas.js](https://github.com/muaz-khan/WebRTC-Experiment/tree/master/part-of-screen-sharing) is used to capture HTML-snapshots. Those snapshots are encoded in webp; and then encoded again in webm.

You can say it: "HTML/Canvas Recording using RecordRTC"!

<canvas></canvas>
<script>
var canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
var recorder = new CanvasRecorder(window.canvasElementToBeRecorded, {
    disableLogs: false
});

// start recording <canvas> drawings
recorder.record();

// a few minutes later
recorder.stop(function(blob) {
    var url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    window.open(url);
});
</script>
