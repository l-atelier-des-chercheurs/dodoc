# do•doc

do•doc (or dodoc) is a free and open-source documentation tool, initially designed for use in classrooms with children. It enables one to capture traces from an on-going experience for later reflections, reconstructions and creation of narratives. A physical device can be associated with the software to simplify usage, especially with young people. Two versions are available: the local app that can be installed for offline use, and the online webapp that can be accessed from any device connected to the Internet.<br><br>

do•doc is created by a variety of people: pupils, teachers, trainers, makers, artists, etc. Anyone is welcome to contribute to its development, on Github or via the forum (contributions can be in English or French): https://forum.latelier-des-chercheurs.fr/<br>
<br>

do•doc was initially created by [l'Atelier des chercheurs](http://latelier-des-chercheurs.fr/) (Sarah Garcin, Pauline Gourlet & Louis Eveillard).<br><br>

# How the core works

Everything is structured in folders/files, so as to mirror the content in the filesystem. No database is used, almost all the content are saved in the content folder (by default /Documents/dodoc_next).

Folders contain a meta.txt file and media files (images, videos, audios, 3D/stl, texts, or any other kind of files).

## Properties and values

### Folders

Default values are:

```
- $admins           (Array, editable)                     list of admins paths
- $contributors     (Array, editable)                     list of contributors paths
- $cover            (Object, editable)                    if a meta_cover.jpeg is present in the root of the folder
- $preview          (String, editable)                    if set, search for a meta filename in this folder and read it when reading folder (useful for advanced cover of this folder)
- $date_created     (Date)                                when the folder was created
- $date_modified    (Date)                                when the folder was last edited
- $files            (Array)                               list of all the files in this folder (see Files below)
- $status           (String, editable)                    determines whether the folder gets listed
- $public           (Boolean, editable)                   if true, return that folder, its files, and its source medias even when request is not auth
- $password         (String, editable, stored as hash)    limit editing to users with password
- $path             (String)                              path to folder, matches filesystem structure and URL
- $infos            (Object)                              data gathered from the folder itself (only available when url is appended with ?detailed=true)
  - size            (Number)                              size in bytes
```

Custom values can be defined in the schema property in settings_base.json.
Editable default values and all custom values can only be edited by an $admins.

Default values are:

```
- $admins           (Array, editable)                     list of admins paths (will be used to set file permissions in the future)

```

Custom values can be defined in the schema property in settings_base.json.
Editable default values and all custom values can only be edited by an $admins.

## Security and visibility

### Status

Each folder and each file have a "$status" property, which defines who can read them using getFolders, getFolder, getFiles and getFile:

- by default, it is set to **private**: folder will only be listed by their respective authors and instance admins.
- otherwise, if set to anything else, they will be listed by anyone (loggedin or not, as long as they have access to dodoc)

### Password

If a folder has a $password, then this ressource and its content can only be edited by people that are logged in to this folder using its password.

### Editing

If a folder has $admins, only people logged in with a token that matches one of these $admin path can edit/remove this folder's meta and its subfolders.

If a folder has $contributors, people logged in with a token that matches one of these $contributors can not edit this folder's meta but can create/edit/remove subfolders or import/edit/remove files.

If a folder has `$contributors = "everyone"`, all users (including anonymous, non logged-in users) have contributors' permissions.
If a folder has `$admins = "everyone"`, all users (including anonymous) have admins' permissions.
If a folder has `$admins = "parent_contributors"` then all parent's $contributors are admins to this folder. This is the same behaviour as files in that parent folder.

These permissions trickle down: an instance admin has admin rights to all the instance contents. A space admin has admin rights to all its projects. A project admin has admin rights to all its content (medias, stopmotions, publications).

An instance contributor, though, only has contributors rights to the direct content it contains. For instance, a contributor to a space can create a project, but not remove a project he/she is not an $admin of.

If a folder type schema has the property `$can_be_created_by: "everyone"`, this overrides the above behaviour and such folder can be created by all users even those that are not logged in. This is useful for accounts creation.

If a folder has `$can_be_remixed = true`, it can be remixed: duplicated somewhere else to the same level. When it is remixed, the path to the new folder gets appended to the array `$list_of_remixes` and the remix folder gets a `$is_remix_of` string.

## Examples

### Schema and path

The path to a ressource is decomposed like this:

`/type-of-ressource/name-of-ressource/type-of-child-ressource/name-of-child-ressource`

For example, with the following schema:

```
{
  "schema": {
    "$folders": {
      "spaces": {
        "$cover": {
          "width": 1200,
          "height": 1200,
          "thumbs": {
            "resolutions": [50, 320, 640, 1200]
          }
        },
        "fields": {
          "title": {
            "type": "string"
          }
        },
        "$folders": {
          "projects": {
            "$cover": {
              "width": 2000,
              "height": 2000,
              "thumbs": {
                "resolutions": [50, 320, 640, 2000]
              }
            },
            "fields": {
              "title": {
                "type": "string",
                "unique": true
              }
            },
            "$folders": {
              "publications": {
                "$cover": {
                  "width": 1200,
                  "height": 1200,
                  "thumbs": {
                    "resolutions": [50, 320, 640, 1200]
                  }
                },
                "fields": {
                  "title": {
                    "type": "string"
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then the following routes will redirect to:

- /spaces
  --> returns a list of all folders in /spaces with their metas

- /spaces/bonjour
  --> returns the meta of a single "bonjour" folder with a list of all their files with their metas

- /spaces/bonjour/projects
  --> returns a list of all folders in /spaces/bonjour/projects with their metas

- /spaces/bonjour/projects/elephant-with-plywood
  --> returns the meta of a single "elephant-with-plywood" folder with a list of all their files with their metas

- /spaces/bonjour/projects/elephant-with-plywood.zip
  --> downloads a zip file with all the content of that folder

### Permission

For an existing folder:

```
Role                  | Edit | Upload file | Create subfolder | Export | Copy |  Download | GeneratePreview |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instance admins       |   x  |     x       |        x         |    x   |   x  |     x     |        x        |
Folder $admins        |   x  |     x       |        x         |    x   |   x  |     x     |        x        |
Folder $contributors  |      |     x       |        x         |        |      |           |                 |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

So, for example for a space /bonjour, its $admins can edit all meta properties while a contributor can only import/edit/remove files, and create projects (of which they'll be $admins by default).
