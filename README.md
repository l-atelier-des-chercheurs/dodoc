# do•doc

do•doc (or dodoc) is a free and open-source documentation tool, initially designed for use in classrooms with children. It enables one to capture traces from an on-going experience for later reflections, reconstructions and creation of narratives. A physical device can be associated with the software to simplify usage, especially with young people. Two versions are available: the local app that can be installed for offline use, and the online webapp that can be accessed from any device connected to the Internet.<br><br>

do•doc is created by a variety of people: pupils, teachers, trainers, makers, artists, etc. Anyone is welcome to contribute to its development, on Github or via the forum (contributions can be in English or French): https://forum.latelier-des-chercheurs.fr/<br>
<br>

do•doc was initially created by [l'Atelier des chercheurs](http://latelier-des-chercheurs.fr/) (Sarah Garcin, Pauline Gourlet & Louis Eveillard).<br><br>

# Install do•doc

### Method 1 — the easy way

Download the latest release from the [release page](https://github.com/l-atelier-des-chercheurs/dodoc/releases).

### Method 2 — the long way

_You need [node.js version 16.14.2](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v16.14.2/) and [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/) to install this app with this method. On Windows, you also need to install Microsoft’s Windows Build Tools by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejs-guidelines/blob/master/windows-environment.md#prerequisites)._

#### 1. Download this repository

Click on _Clone or Download_ in the top right corner of this page, then _Download ZIP_. Unpack this folder.

#### 2. Open a terminal window

Open a terminal window:

- Windows: (XP) use [this tutorial](http://wikistrea.fr/Comment_ouvrir_la_console_de_commande_Windows_en_mode_administrateur_%3F) to open a terminal on Windows or open Command Prompt in the start menu
- macOS: go to Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal
- Linux: use a terminal app such as Terminal or Konsole

In your terminal, navigate to the dodoc-master folder with your terminal using the `cd` command:

```
cd path/to/dodoc-master
```

#### 3. Install dependencies

If you haven’t already, install the tool that will enable native modules to be used. To do this, follow the instructions here: https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp

Then, install _do•doc_’s dependencies (may take up to 5 minutes):

```
npm install
```

#### 4. Run do•doc

Start from the folder in a terminal window with the following command:

```
npm start
```

#### Troubleshooting

Most install errors (and especially the _Module version mismatch._) are due to native packages such as [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp), a powerful image manipulation library.

**The first thing to check is whether you use the right version of node.js: it must be version 16.14.2.
To know the version you are running, write `node -v` in a terminal window.**

The reason you have to use this version of node.js is because this app uses Electron, a tool to package node.js and a webbrowser as native apps. The version of Electron this app is using is version 19.1.9, and it uses node version 16.14.2. However, when native modules are built, they are built using the local node version and not Electron’s. Hence, you have to run the exact same version as Electron to prevent this type of error to happen.

Because switching between node version is tedious, it is recommended to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to do so ([nvm windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) for Windows).

Here are a few other things you can try (but only after making sure you run the right node version):

1.  Sometimes, Electron is not installed when running `npm install` on the repo. It may help to run `npm install electron@2.0.5` just to be sure it is actually installed locally.

1.  Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules.md), and specifically:

```
# Electron's version.
export npm_config_target=19.1.9
# The architecture of Electron, can be ia32 or x64.
export npm_config_arch=arm64
export npm_config_target_arch=arm64
# Download headers for Electron.
export npm_config_disturl=https://atom.io/download/electron
# Tell node-pre-gyp that we are building for Electron.
export npm_config_runtime=electron
# Tell node-pre-gyp to build module from source code.
export npm_config_build_from_source=true
# Install all dependencies, and store cache to ~/.electron-gyp.
HOME=~/.electron-gyp npm install
```

3.  electron-builder (which builds electron to an app) embeds a script that rebuilds dependencies according to electron. To use it, write:

```
./node_modules/.bin/electron-builder install-app-deps
```

4. use electron-rebuilt as well

```
./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild
```

**sharp on ubuntu**

It seems the dependency sharp cannot be built easily on Ubuntu. Install an older version to fix this:

```
npm install sharp@0.17.3
```

# Tweak, fork and debug

### server-side

- Run `npm run debug` to start the server with a better debug in terminal

### client-side

The client-side code is in the `public` folder. To write some new CSS or client-side JS, you need to run the following tasks:

```
npm run install
```

and then, to start the dev tasks:

```
npm run dev
```

To build for production, use

```
npm run build
```

This will create minified JS files in the `public/dist` folder.

# How the core works

Everything is structured in folders/files, so as to mirror the content in the filesystem. No database is used, almost all the content are saved in the content folder (by default /Documents/dodoc_next).

Folders contain a meta.txt file and media files (images, videos, audios, 3D/stl, texts, or any other kind of files).

## Properties and values

### Folders

Default values are:

```
- $admins           (Array, editable)                     list of admins paths
- $contributors     (Array, editable)                     list of contributors paths
- $cover            (Object, editable)                    if a meta_cover.jpeg is present in the root of the folder
- $date_created     (Date)                                when the folder was created
- $date_modified    (Date)                                when the folder was last edited
- $files            (Array)                               list of all the files in this folder (see Files below)
- $status           (String, editable)                    determines whether the folder gets listed
- $password         (String, editable, stored as hash)    limit editing to users with password
- $path             (String)                              path to folder, matches filesystem structure and URL
- $infos            (Object)                              data gathered from the folder itself (only available when url is appended with ?detailed=true)
  - size            (Number)                              size in bytes
```

Custom values can be defined in the schema property in settings_base.json.
Editable default values and all custom values can only be edited by an $admins.

### Files

Each file has default values and custom values as well.
Default values are:

```
- $admins           (Array, editable)                     list of admins paths (will be used to set file permissions in the future)
- $contributors     (Array, editable)                     list of contributors paths (will be used to set file permissions in the future)
- $authors          (Array, editable)                     list of authors paths (information only, not actually used server-side)
- $path             (String)                              path to meta text file, matches filesystem structure and URL
- $date_created     (Date)                                when the file was created
- $date_uploaded    (Date)                                when the file was uploaded
- $date_modified    (Date)                                when the file was last edited
- $media_filename   (String, editable)                    name of the file
- $type             (String, editable)                    type of media file among the following: _image, video, audio, stl, text, pdf, other_
- $status           (String, editable)                    determines whether the file gets listed when getFiles is called by non-authors
- $origin           (String, editable)                    used to indicate the origin of the media (capture page, upload, etc.)
- $optimized        (Boolean, editable)                   used to indicate whether the media has been optimized or not
- $thumbs           (object)                              list of possible media image thumbs
- $content          (String, editable)                    text content of a file
- $infos            (object)                              data gathered from the file itself
  - mtimems         (Date)                                last modified time for media file
  - duration        (Number)                              for videos and audios
  - width           (Number)                              for images and videos
  - height          (Number)                              for images and videos
  - ratio           (Number)                              for images and videos
  - size            (Number)                              size in bytes
  - gps             (Object)
  - hash            (String)                              file hash (to find duplicates)
```

Custom values can be defined in the schema property in settings_base.json.
Editable default values and all custom values can only be edited by an $admins.

## Security and visibility

### Status

Each folder and each file have a "$status" property, which defines who can read them using getFolders, getFolder, getFiles and getFile:

- by default, it is set to **private**: folder will only be listed by their respective authors and instance admins.
- otherwise, if set to anything else, they will be listed by anyone (loggedin or not, as long as they have access to dodoc)

### Password

If a folder has a $password, then this ressource and its content can only be edited by people that are logged in to this folder using its password.

### Editing

If a folder has $admins, only people logged in with a token that matches one of these $admin path can edit/remove this folder's meta and its subfolders.

If a folder has $contributors, people logged in with a token that matches one of these $contributors can not edit this folder's meta but can create/edit/remove subfolders or import/edit/remove files.

If a folder has `$contributors = "everyone"`, all users (including anonymous, non logged-in users) have contributors' permissions.
If a folder has `$admins = "everyone"`, all users (including anonymous) have admins' permissions.
If a folder has `$admins = "parent_contributors"` then all parent's $contributors are admins to this folder. This is the same behaviour as files in that parent folder.

These permissions trickle down: an instance admin has admin rights to all the instance contents. A space admin has admin rights to all its projects. A project admin has admin rights to all its content (medias, stopmotions, publications).

An instance contributor, though, only has contributors rights to the direct content it contains. For instance, a contributor to a space can create a project, but not remove a project he/she is not an $admin of.

If a folder type schema has the property `$can_be_created_by: "everyone"`, this overrides the above behaviour and such folder can be created by all users even those that are not logged in. This is useful for accounts creation.

If a folder has `$can_be_remixed = true`, it can be remixed: duplicated somewhere else to the same level. When it is remixed, the path to the new folder gets appended to the array `$list_of_remixes` and the remix folder gets a `$is_remix_of` string.

## Examples

### Schema and path

The path to a ressource is decomposed like this:

`/type-of-ressource/name-of-ressource/type-of-child-ressource/name-of-child-ressource`

For example, with the following schema:

```
{
  "schema": {
    "$folders": {
      "spaces": {
        "$cover": {
          "width": 1200,
          "height": 1200,
          "thumbs": {
            "resolutions": [50, 320, 640, 1200]
          }
        },
        "fields": {
          "title": {
            "type": "string"
          }
        },
        "$folders": {
          "projects": {
            "$cover": {
              "width": 2000,
              "height": 2000,
              "thumbs": {
                "resolutions": [50, 320, 640, 2000]
              }
            },
            "fields": {
              "title": {
                "type": "string",
                "unique": true
              }
            },
            "$folders": {
              "publications": {
                "$cover": {
                  "width": 1200,
                  "height": 1200,
                  "thumbs": {
                    "resolutions": [50, 320, 640, 1200]
                  }
                },
                "fields": {
                  "title": {
                    "type": "string"
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then the following routes will redirect to:

- /spaces
  --> returns a list of all folders in /spaces with their metas

- /spaces/bonjour
  --> returns the meta of a single "bonjour" folder with a list of all their files with their metas

- /spaces/bonjour/projects
  --> returns a list of all folders in /spaces/bonjour/projects with their metas

- /spaces/bonjour/projects/elephant-with-plywood
  --> returns the meta of a single "elephant-with-plywood" folder with a list of all their files with their metas

- /spaces/bonjour/projects/elephant-with-plywood.zip
  --> downloads a zip file with all the content of that folder

### Permission

For an existing folder:

```
Role                  | Edit | Upload file | Create subfolder | Export | Copy |  Download | GeneratePreview |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instance admins       |   x  |     x       |        x         |    x   |   x  |     x     |        x        |
Folder $admins        |   x  |     x       |        x         |    x   |   x  |     x     |        x        |
Folder $contributors  |      |     x       |        x         |        |      |           |                 |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

So, for example for a space /bonjour, its $admins can edit all meta properties while a contributor can only import/edit/remove files, and create projects (of which they'll be $admins by default).
